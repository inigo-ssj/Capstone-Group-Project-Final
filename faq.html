            <h2>What is the shipping policy for Everwear?</h2>
            <p>
              We offer standard and express shipping to all locations in the
              Philippines. Orders are processed within 1-2 business days, and
              delivery typically takes between 3-7 business days depending on
              your location.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>How do I track my order?</h2>
            <p>
              Once your order has been shipped, you will receive a tracking
              number via email. You can use this tracking number to monitor the
              progress of your delivery through the courier’s tracking system.
            </p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Can I change my order after it's been placed?</h2>
            <p>
              We process orders quickly, but if you wish to make any changes,
              please contact our support team as soon as possible. We may be
              able to make changes before the order is shipped, but
              unfortunately, we cannot guarantee changes once your order is in
              processing or shipped.

              Unfortunately, certain items such as accessories or undergarments
              are non-returnable due to hygiene reasons. Please refer to our
